# Because of Hope

[becauseofhope.org](http://www.becauseofhope.org) _Not yet deployed!_

This is the source for Because of Hope's website. BOH is a 501(c)(3)
organization. 

The website and infrastructure is still under heavy development and iteration.
It is meant to replace the $20 a month VPS that currently serves 2 HTML files
with a GoDaddy domain name/DNS with an Amazon S3-backed static website with
a domain name/DNS not by GoDaddy at least. BOH will be paying pennies,
literally. 

For now, all artwork, text, and design that made by Because of Hope should be
considered "All Rights Reserved". Everything else is under their original
license.
