# Because of Hope Website

[https://becauseofhope.org](http://www.becauseofhope.org)

This is the sourcecode for Because of Hope's website. BOH is a 501(c)(3)
organization in Santa Barbara that helps widows and orphans through sustainable
means.

## License

All artwork, text, and design that made by Because of Hope should be
considered "All Rights Reserved". Everything else is under their original
license or BSD. You are more than welcome to use them as reference for your own
nanoc-powered site.

## Development

This project is in a freeze technology-wise. For a static site, this is pretty fine.
The stuff in the Gemfiles will only be updated if it fails to compile on newer
OS versions. No major refactoring is on the horizon.

Ruby 2.1 is the last Ruby version supported. Luckily, since this is just
a statically generated site, this is fine.

## History

We were replacing:

* $20/month VPS, GoDaddy registar/DNS, 2 HTML files

with

* 3¢/month Amazon S3 Static Website hosting, Cloudflare, Namecheap

This new setup allowed BOH to take on multiple DDOS attacks were it to ever
happen from the internets and get away with paying for it all with the change
we find in the couch or nothing since Amazon waives all bills with less than 12¢
in them.

## Tools used

* Zurb Foundation
* Compass
* nanoc
* haml
