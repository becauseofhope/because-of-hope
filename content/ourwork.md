## Our Mission

BOH seeks to sustainably empower widows and orphans living in Uganda. In addition, BOH aims to spread compassionate global awareness within our local communities. We hope to unite people from different continents and cultures with the purpose of generating lasting solutions to the problems that arise from poverty.

## Our Committment to Sustainability

We commit to creating lasting, self-sustaining change. To do this, BOH works in partnership with an Ugandan organization, WOCAP, to design, implement, and maintain programs to target specific contributing factors to poverty. Being committed to sustainability means we refuse to give handouts. Instead, BOH and WOCAP use existing resources in new ways to empower the women and children we work with. To learn more about how we do this, take a look at our three programs: the Beads Project, BOH Student Scholarship Program (BSSP), and the Agriculture Program.
