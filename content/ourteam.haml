              Jordan, whose friends call her Jordy, is BSSP’s U.S. Advisor and she started working for BOH in early 2015. She received her bachelor’s degree in Communication Studies from Texas Christian University. Her favorite part of her job is going to Uganda to visit the BSSP students and working with the Uganda BSSP staff team to prepare for the new school year. She actively raises awareness about BSSP in the U.S. and enjoys sharing about the students’ progress with donors. Jordy is a stud at soccer (arguably due to her webbed feet), loves ice cream, and at dusk, can be found watching the sunset in the backyard.
