## Return Policy

### Exchanges

Because of the unique nature of our handmade jewelry, each item varies in length & color.  There is a small chance you will receive a piece slightly different than you expect or see in the sample pictures (bead size, order of beads, length, etc.). We will gladly exchange any item for the same piece within 30 days of original shipment date, if we have the item in stock. Your returned item must be in the original condition.

### Refunds

We accept returns within 30 days of original shipment date. We can refund your order in full or you may exchange for an item of the same price range.

### Warranty

Damaged necklaces may be returned within 30 days of original shipment date in exchange for the same necklace only.

Because of Hope reserves the right to restrict or disallow exchanges or refunds for any reason.
