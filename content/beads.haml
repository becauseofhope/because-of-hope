  BOHâ€™s Ugandan partner organization, WOCAP, began their beading program to
  provide roughly 250 women with a means of generating income to help support
  their families. The women are taught how to make beads from recycled paper.
  The paper is rolled around a sewing needle, sometimes dyed different colors,
  and then varnished to make a bead. In addition to bead-making, the women are
  also taught sewing skills. The women hand make necklaces, bracelets,
  earrings, and handbags to be sold in the U.S.
