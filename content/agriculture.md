## Livelihood

Agriculture is an integral part of life in Uganda and an effective tool to sustainably battle poverty. As of the beginning of 2015, we are pleased to add agriculture to our strategy in our mission toward sustainability.

##The Problem

The majority of our women in Uganda are farmers. However, traditional farming methods have led to low, inconsistent crop yields and a multitude of frustrations for our women. A poor crop harvest can be devastating to an impoverished family when it is their primary source of food and a supplemental source of income.

## Our Strategy

After researching successful farming programs in our area in Uganda, we decided with the women to implement an Agriculture Program that addresses physical, social, and spiritual livelihood for participants. Because of the complexity of poverty, this programâ€™s effectiveness comes from the fact that it not only teaches effective farming methods, but also builds up participants individually and as a group, empowering them to combat poverty in all areas of their lives.
