description: Hi, my name is Awin o Tereza. I am 81 years old. I live in Jinja and speak the language of Acholi. I joined WOCAP so I could take care of the needs of my grandchildren. With the money that I make from WOCAP I use to buy scholastic materials from my grandchildren and also paraffin, salt and soap.
