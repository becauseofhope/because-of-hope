description: Hi, my name is Nakaliti Ruth. I am 35 years old. I currently live in Bubugo and speak the language of Lusoga. I joined WOCAP because I wanted to empower myself in such a way that I could supply the money to take care of my 11 children. I was able to support my family by working for WOCAP.
