description: Hi, my name is Muwanguzi Ruth. I am 44 years old. I currently live in Bubugo. I am a HIV/AIDS patient and I was hoping that WOCAP would be able to help me since most of the village clinics do not have ARV's treatment. Ever since I have joined they have always endeavored to help me get treatment.
