description: Hi, my name is Biida Elivaida. I am 85 years old. I currently live in Namagera and I have lost my sight. I wake at 7:00 a.m. every morning to go to the garden to dig up food for my grandchildren.I had 4 orphans who were in great need of help, so I joined so that I could help these children.
