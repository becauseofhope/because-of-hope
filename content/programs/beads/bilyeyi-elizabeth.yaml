description: Hi, my name is Bilyeyi Elizabeth. I am 58 years old. I currently live in Namagera (Jinja district) and speak the language of Lulamogi and Lusoga. I want to thank the people who sell the beads in the U.S., you bring light to our homes. I want to thank all who buy the beads and may God reward you abundantly.
