## Santa Barbara Veteranâ€™s Day Half Marathon
BOH is teaming up with Santa Barbara Marathon for our cause! We invite you to join us in our mission to sustainably empowering widows and orphans in Uganda by running Saturday, November 12th, 2016.

## What We Do
We work with a group of 225 women in Uganda and their children to break the cycle of poverty. We do this not by handouts, but by collaborating with the women in developing programs together which tackle the challenges they face.

## How You Help
Run for BOH and fundraise by sharing with family, friends, and co-workers about making an impact in Uganda! They can join in making an impact by donating to your fundraising goal of $1,000. Your fundraising is two-fold and also helps raise awareness with networks of people only YOU can reach!

## Options for Running

Half Marathon Relay: 13.1 miles-2 person teams
