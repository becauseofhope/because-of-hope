  ## Donate towards a runner's goal

  Our passionate group of runners are training hard for the purpose of raising awareness and funding for BOH.  This funding significantly impacts BOHâ€™s ability to grow our programs to reach sustainability and empowerment in Uganda!

  On behalf of our runners, BOH team, the women and their families, THANK YOU!
